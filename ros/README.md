# ROS Example

This example shows how to start [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) with [Lizard](https://lizard.dev/) on the [Zauberzeug Robot Brain](https://zauberzeug.com/product-robot-brain.html).
For simplicity we use [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/) to present a website with control elements:

The built-in NVIDIA Jetson is running a rather old Ubuntu LTS 18.04.
Therefore it is best to start ROS in a docker container.
We created a small helper script `docker.sh` for simplicity.
Run

```bash
./docker.sh build
./docker.sh run
```

to build and start the image in a new container.
You should then be able to open the user interface on http://localhost.

## ROS Nodes

The example consists of two ROS nodes `lizard` and `ui`.
The first handles the Lizard communication with the microcontroller within the Robot Brain for sending speed commands to the wheels.
The latter is just a demonstration of a seperate node which generates twist messages through a web interface with [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/).
You can replace this with any other node as needed.

## Configure Lizard

By sending the `/configure` message to the `lizard` node the microcontroller will receive the configuration of the attached devices (an ODrive motor controller with two wheels) stored in the `startup.liz` file.
The configuration is stored persitently on the microcontroller, so you only need to save it once.

In the example the web page provides a button to trigger the `/configure` message.
In a real scenario you would do it when deploying the robot.

## Starting on Reboot

You can configure the example to directly start on reboot or crash by running

```bash
./docker.sh install
```
